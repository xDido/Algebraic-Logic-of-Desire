# Algebraic-Logic-of-Desire
Desire is a fundamental aspect of human motivation and agency, yet its complexities have
proven challenging to capture in formal representations. This thesis addresses the study
of desire using the algebraic language Log_AC_n.
Building upon previous work, we propose a formal framework that enables a more
comprehensive representation and analysis of desireâ€™s properties. Our approach provides
a rigorous and expressive language for describing desire, with potential implications for
both philosophical inquiry into motivation and agency, and the development of more
sophisticated and human-like intelligent agents in artificial intelligence research. This
thesis presents a systematic exploration of desire within Log_AC_n framework, proving key
propositions about its properties and behavior.
